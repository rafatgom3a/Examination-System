# Simple Examinations System

## ðŸ“– Project Description

The Simple Examinations System is a web-based application designed to provide a multiple-choice exam experience. It includes a timer, randomized questions and answers, and an intuitive interface for students.

## ðŸš€ Features

1. Student Name Input: A popup library is used to take the studentâ€™s name before starting the exam.

2. Randomized Questions & Answers: Each exam session presents a shuffled set of questions and randomized answer choices.

3. Single-Question Display: One question appears at a time, with a "Next" button for navigation.

4. Answer Selection: Only one answer can be selected per question, with a visual indicator (gray background) for the chosen answer.

5. Exam Timer: A progress bar displays the remaining time (1 minute per question).

6. Result Display: At the end, the student's result is shown either when all questions are answered or when the timer expires.
